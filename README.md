# grad-nite-2k17

## Inspiration
Graduation is coming up for the class of 2017. For our church, we celebrate our graduates by working on a performance, skit, and/or video.

For our Sophomore class, we decided to create a meta video that showed the process of us brainstorming in preparation to bless the graduates. The end goal was to send off an email to each of the graduates at the climax of the video. Rather than manually doing that, or relying on a google extension such as Boomerang, we programatically created some code that would compile all our messages, format, and send them out with a click of a button (or more a comman on the terminal).
